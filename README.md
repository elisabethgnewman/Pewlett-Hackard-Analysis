# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this module was to understand how to use SQL and learn how to create entity relationship diagrams and queries using SQL. In the module and challenge, we were presented with a number of CSV files. The CSV files had information related to the Pewlett-Hackard employees, including employee number, title, first and last name, and birth date, to name a few. We identified primary and foreign keys within these ERDs and created our data tables using pgAdmin. For this challenge, we used the skills we learned in the module to determine the number of employees eligible for retirement and for the company's mentorship program. 

## Results
You can find the results of this challenge in the folder titled "Analysis" and under "Data." The output CSV files that I produced from this module include: retirement_titles.csv, unique_titles.csv, retiring_titles.csv, and mentorship_eligibilty.csv. The code can be found in the "Analysis" folder under "Queries."

The results of deliverable 1 gave us all of the employees with birthdays between 1952 and 1955. I removed duplicates by grouping by employee number. Below is an image of the count of employees by title eligible for retirement:

The results of deliverable 2 gave us all of the employees with birthdays in 1965 who were eligible for the mentorship program. This can be found in the file titled: mentorship_eligibilty.csv.

## Summary
In this module and challenge, we learned about using SQL to query data and create relationships between data tables. We learned how to use INNER JOIN, GROUP BY, and DISTINCT, which were necessary to complete the challenge. SQL is used across many companies and is the most common query language. Understanding the basic syntax for SQL will allow me to better understand the queries I pull in my current role.
