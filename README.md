# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this module was to understand how to use SQL and learn how to create entity relationship diagrams and queries using SQL. In the module and challenge, we were presented with a number of CSV files. The CSV files had information related to the Pewlett-Hackard employees, including employee number, title, first and last name, and birth date, to name a few. We identified primary and foreign keys within these ERDs and created our data tables using pgAdmin. For this challenge, we used the skills we learned in the module to determine the number of employees eligible for retirement and for the company's mentorship program.
